&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog. After years of procrastination, today I finally muster up all my courage together to actually start writing blogs. Blogs are an excellent way to share your experience to other people at a scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading a lot of blogs, I found out that there is a gap in blogs for beginners. When I started my computer science journey, I could not find good blogs to guide me. At that time, I saw people saying, “read blogs”, and then when I went to read some blogs, all I found was intermediate blogs, which made a bad picture of blogs in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
