# my-first-blog

Hey everyone. 

This is my first blog. After years of procrastination, today I finally muster up all my courage together to actually start writing blogs. Blogs are an excellent way to share your experience to other people at a scale. 

After reading a lot of blogs, I found out that there is a gap in blogs for beginners. When I started my computer science journey, I could not find good blogs to guide me. At that time, I saw people saying, “read blogs”, and then when I went to read some blogs, all I found was intermediate blogs, which made a bad picture of blogs in my mind. 

I will try to keep the blogs as simple as possible, and initially will target the most common problems everyone face. These blogs will reflect my own journey, the progress I am making gradually in my career. These blogs will mostly contain technical information and my opinion and personal believes on various topics. 

Thanks a lot for reading!
